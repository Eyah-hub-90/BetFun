#  BetFun - A Decentralized Prediction Market

**A fully decentralized prediction market platform on Solana enabling users to create custom markets, add liquidity, place token-based bets, and automatically resolve outcomes using Switchboard oracles and Anchor smart contracts.**

BetFun is an open-source decentralized prediction market built on Solana, allowing users to create, participate, add liquidity, and resolve prediction events using smart contracts.

>  Bet on real-world outcomes. Earn if you're right. Built for transparency, fairness, and community governance.

## 🔐 Token-Gated Market Creation

BetFun implements token gating to ensure quality market creation and prevent spam. To create prediction markets, users must hold a minimum of **500,000 BetFun tokens** in their wallet.

### How Token Gating Works

1. **Backend Validation** – When a user attempts to create a market, the backend verifies their SPL token balance via the Solana blockchain
2. **Frontend Checks** – The UI automatically checks the user's token balance and displays their eligibility status
3. **Real-time Feedback** – Users see their current balance and how many more tokens they need (if any)
4. **Disabled Submission** – The "Create Market" button is disabled if the user doesn't meet the minimum requirement

### Configuration

Token gating can be configured in:
- **Backend**: `BetFun/BackEnd/src/config.ts` - Set `tokenGateConfig`
- **Frontend**: `BetFun/FrontEnd/src/utils/index.ts` - Set `TOKEN_GATE_CONFIG`

To disable token gating for testing, set `enabled: false` in both configurations.

### Required Environment Variables

- `GATE_TOKEN_MINT` (Backend) - The SPL token mint address
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_GATE_TOKEN_MINT` (Frontend) - Same token mint address for client-side checks

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Backend Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `BackEnd` directory:

```env
PORT=9000
DB_URL=your_mongodb_connection_string
PASSKEY=your_passkey
FEE_AUTHORITY=your_fee_authority_public_key
SOLANA_RPC=your_solana_rpc_endpoint
GATE_TOKEN_MINT=your_token_mint_address_for_gating
```

You can copy from the example file:
```bash
cd BackEnd
cp env.example .env
# Then edit .env with your actual values
```

### Frontend Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the `FrontEnd` directory:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_GATE_TOKEN_MINT=your_token_mint_address_for_gating
```

You can copy from the example file:
```bash
cd FrontEnd
cp .env.example .env.local
# Then edit .env.local with your actual token mint address
```

### Frontend Configuration

The frontend is configured to connect to Solana Devnet by default. You can modify the RPC endpoint in `FrontEnd/src/app/layout.tsx` if needed.

### Smart Contract Configuration

The smart contract is configured for Solana Devnet. Check `prediction-market-smartcontract/Anchor.toml` for configuration details.

##  Running the Application

### Backend Server

```bash
cd BackEnd

# Development mode (with hot reload)
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev

# Production mode
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

The backend server will run on `http://localhost:9000` (or the port specified in your `.env` file).

### Frontend Application

```bash
cd FrontEnd

# Development mode
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev

# Production build
npm run build
npm start
# or
yarn build
yarn start
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Smart Contract

```bash
cd prediction-market-smartcontract

# Build the contract
anchor build

# Deploy to devnet
anchor deploy

# Run tests
anchor test
```

##  API Endpoints

The backend provides the following API endpoints (all prefixed with `/api`):

### Market Endpoints
- `POST /api/market/create` - Create a new prediction market
- `POST /api/market/add` - Add additional market information
- `POST /api/market/addLiquidity` - Add liquidity to a market
- `POST /api/market/betting` - Place a bet on a market
- `POST /api/market/liquidity` - Alternative liquidity endpoint
- `GET /api/market/get` - Get market data

### Oracle Endpoints
- `POST /api/oracle/registFeed` - Register a custom oracle feed

### Referral Endpoints
- `POST /api/referral/` - Get or generate referral code
- `POST /api/referral/claim` - Claim referral rewards

### Profile Endpoints
- `GET /api/profile/` - Get user profile data

---

##  How It Works

1. **Create Market** – A user creates a prediction event with a question (e.g., "Will BTC hit $80k by Dec 2025?")
2. **Add Liquidity** – Users can fund markets to increase liquidity. Once a threshold is reached, betting becomes active.
3. **Participants Bet** – Users place stakes on "Yes" or "No" outcomes by purchasing tokens. Token prices fluctuate based on market probability.
4. **Locking Period** – Market closes at deadline; no more bets are accepted.
5. **Resolution** – Oracle fetches real-world outcome automatically from Switchboard feeds.
6. **Payout** – Winners are rewarded proportionally based on their token holdings.

### Market States

- **Pending** – Market created but liquidity threshold not met
- **Active** – Market is open for betting
- **Resolved** – Oracle has determined the outcome, winners can claim rewards

##  Development

### Backend Development

The backend uses TypeScript with Express. Key directories:
- `src/controller/` - Business logic
- `src/router/` - API route definitions
- `src/model/` - MongoDB schemas
- `src/prediction_market_sdk/` - Solana blockchain interactions

### Frontend Development

The frontend uses Next.js 15 with the App Router. Key directories:
- `src/app/` - Pages and routes
- `src/components/` - Reusable React components
- `src/providers/` - Context providers for global state

### Smart Contract Development

The smart contract is written in Rust using the Anchor framework:
- `programs/prediction/src/` - Main program logic
- `programs/prediction/src/instructions/` - Individual instruction handlers
- `programs/prediction/src/states/` - Account state definitions

---

##  Testing

### Smart Contract Tests

```bash
cd prediction-market-smartcontract
anchor test
```

### Backend Tests

Currently, backend tests are not configured. You can add test scripts to `BackEnd/package.json`.
